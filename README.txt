#This repository uses various calculations and convertors to return the pace of a run.

#The pace_calculator.py is the full program that times in units, distance, time, and returns the pace.

#As part of the pace_calculator, a km_to_miles.py and miles_to_km.py program were created.
#These were created in case the user desires a pace that's different from the units they ran it in.

#seconds_minutes_converter.py converts the seconds part of a mm:ss input into a decimal format that can be used as part of the pace calculation.

#All of these functions are part of the pace_calculator.py script, but have been separated out in case you'd like those tools by themselves.
